Names of comments
There 2 names for comments there is "/*" Multi - line
// "//" normal comment*/

/* logging
Well Console.log Is just really understandable beacause its just like other Coding-launguages
Roblox-lua print does the same thing as console.log
Python print does the  same thing as the others.

/* Data Types and variables:
undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object
Explanation
In Computer science data is anything meaningful to the computer and JavaScript Provides 7 diffrent data types that you can use listed above,
Now Some of the more obvious answers and most common are strings  to my knwoledge in the 1 year of coding in lua in roblox strings are these (")
but in javascript a string is any sort of text, now lets move on to a the number the number is obviously a number now lets go from the top,
undefined that hasn't been defined here's an example

var number = 5
Error: Refrence error: (The thing you "defined or tried to"), The tab example "index.js"
But if you don't know or haven't coded at all in roblox null means nothing you can set stuff to nothing like the example under,
var nothing = null 
now over booleans,
booleans are very easy to understand there are only 2 answers to a boolean listed below,
False
True
Now an example to what a boolean can be used for,
EnabledGame = false
EnabledGame = true
A Symbol is a primitive value that is unique now we'll talk about those later,z
Its bassicly just text but just like emojis and stuff,
Now we're gonna be talking about objects we all know what objects are  but in coding they are completly diffrent,
Now a object can store alot of diffrent keywords values pairs and we'll talk about these later
Variables
Now you're often going to set data into variables a variable allows computer to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion it's bassicly a label to point to the data
a variable is just like a box you can store stuff in it bassicly with anything you'll fill it with the data that you want so to declare a variable you want to use the var keyword var stands for variable you can also use other stuff for a variable not only a string
Now heres an example code
var myName = "Jxq" now later you can set it to be whatever like so,

myName = "1234" 
Now there are actaully 3 ways to declare a variable in javascript
var is one of them and for a while that was the only way but
now there is 3 there is a way called "let" now let's use let as an example
We can use it like this

let ourName = console.log("Beau")
Or
let ourName = "612"
and the other thing woud be "const"

const ConstIsAVar = "111"
Now let's talk about what those do
Const is a variable that never changes,
can never change like that variable i made called,
var myName = "Jxq" but i changed it to 1234 by doing this,

myName = "1234"
Like i said earlier you can never change a "const" variable if you try to change it either way you'll get an error
And this will be the error Type Error: Assignment to constant variable
End of Data types and variables
