var myName = "Jxq" // It dosen't have to be your name it can be  other stuff and the variable name dosent have to be "myName" this is just an example.

myName = "1234" // Now later you can set it to be something else if you woud like.
// note it dosent have to be only your name or something it can be something like this,
let Console = console.log("Sheluv")
// Now you might be wondering why i used let instead of "var" we will be talking about that all later.

// Tip: there shoud be some spaces between diffrent lines of code
let ThisIsaDiffrentNameOfAVariable = console.log("123")
